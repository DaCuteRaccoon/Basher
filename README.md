# Basher

**[Basher](https://www.basher.app)** is a web app built using HTML, CSS, jQuery, Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth, and UI). It allows users to submit words, titles, and ratings to user-generated stories.

**Basher** is currently in alpha release, where users are building the first stories, and exposing some flaws we could not come across other ways, like seeing how effective the code is at encouraging users to filter out junk submissions.

All suggestions are welcome!
